# Matrix-Shell-Animations

This set of files includes bash shell scripts which allow users to generate and modify matrix-like animations.

Inspiration for the script comes from another matrix script, by Brett Terpstra, however all code presented in these scripts is my own.

The scripts should work in MacOS.

To run the scripts, open the terminal and navigate to this directory.

In terminal, type "sh filename", where filename is replaced by the respective file name.

Press ctrl+c to stop the animation.
